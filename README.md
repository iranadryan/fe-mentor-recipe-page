This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

It was a fun and simple project to do, I'm trying to use Tailwind more often to fix its classes. I used Figma to help me with the sizes and distances and applied everything with Tailwind, trying to use the most semantic tags in HTML.
